## Transformer Model for Time Series Forecasting: A Deep Dive into Fine-Tuning Techniques

### Introduction

Time series forecasting is pivotal in domains like finance, weather prediction, and inventory management. With the rise of deep learning, the accuracy of forecasting models has dramatically improved. This repository delves into utilizing Transformer models for time series forecasting and explores various fine-tuning techniques to enhance their performance.

### The Transformer Model

Initially designed for natural language processing, Transformers have demonstrated exceptional capabilities across various tasks, including time series forecasting. This project focuses on a streamlined version of the Transformer, tailored for univariate time series data.

#### Model Architecture

Our Transformer model is composed of several key components:

1. **Input Encoding**: Projects the input data into a higher-dimensional space using a linear layer.
2. **Positional Encoding**: Integrates sequence order information into the input using sine and cosine functions.
3. **Transformer Encoder**: The core of the model, featuring self-attention mechanisms and feed-forward networks.
4. **Output Decoding**: A linear layer that converts the encoder's output to the target dimension for forecasting.

### Data Preparation

For effective time series forecasting, data preparation is crucial:

1. **Sliding Window Approach**: We generate input sequences of a fixed length (`SEQUENCE_SIZE` of 10) with corresponding target values.
2. **Normalization**: Data is normalized using StandardScaler to ensure uniform scale across values.

### Fine-Tuning Techniques

Enhancing the Transformer model's performance involves various fine-tuning techniques. This repository explores four such methods:

#### 1. Learning Rate Scheduling

Adjusting the learning rate during training can significantly affect model convergence and performance. We employ the `ReduceLROnPlateau` scheduler:

- Starts with an initial learning rate (0.001).
- Reduces the learning rate by 0.5 if validation performance plateaus for 3 epochs.
- Allows large initial learning rates for rapid progress and fine-tuning as the model converges.

#### 2. Gradual Unfreezing

Inspired by transfer learning, gradual unfreezing stabilizes training by slowly introducing updates to earlier layers:

- Begin training with only the final layer (decoder) unfrozen.
- Gradually unfreeze earlier layers over successive epochs.
- Facilitates adaptation to the task while maintaining stable training.

#### 3. Discriminative Fine-Tuning

Different parts of the model may benefit from varied learning rates. This technique applies different learning rates to the encoder and decoder:

- Assign a higher learning rate (0.001) to the decoder parameters.
- Use a lower learning rate (0.0001) for the encoder parameters.
- Enhances model performance by fine-tuning different layers optimally.

#### 4. Hybrid Approach

Combining the strengths of the above methods, the hybrid approach incorporates:

- Discriminative fine-tuning for nuanced parameter updates.
- Gradual unfreezing to stabilize training.
- Learning rate scheduling for dynamic adjustment during training.

### Evaluation and Comparison

We evaluate these fine-tuning techniques using the following steps:

1. **Training**: Each technique is used to train the model separately.
2. **Monitoring**: Track training and validation losses throughout the process.
3. **Testing**: Evaluate model performance using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) on a test set.
4. **Visualization**: Compare results through:
   - Loss curves for training and validation.
   - Actual vs. predicted value plots.
   - RMSE scores for each method.

These evaluations provide insights into:
- Convergence speed of each technique.
- Final performance and accuracy.
- Comparative effectiveness of individual and combined methods.

### Conclusion

Fine-tuning techniques are vital for optimizing Transformer models in time series forecasting. By employing methods like learning rate scheduling, gradual unfreezing, discriminative fine-tuning, and a hybrid approach, we can significantly enhance model performance and stability.

This repository not only implements these techniques but also encourages exploration of new methods to keep up with advancements in deep learning and time series forecasting.
